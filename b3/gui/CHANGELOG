                 - correctly space buttons in about dialog window
                 - make sure to have a visible MainWindow when a MenuBar action is triggered: on OS X the menubar
                   is visible even though the MainWindow is hidden, so it's possible to launch Dialogs (if such
                   dialogs gets closed while the MainWindow is hidden, the application terminate)

                   installed before copying the plugin directory inside the B3 extplugins folder (will also make sure that
                   the user didn't delete the extplugins folder manually)
