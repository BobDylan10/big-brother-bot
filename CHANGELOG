1.1.5
-----
- Fixed CoD4 Parser

1.1.3
-----
- Added COD4 parser
    - COD4 parser uses GUID instead of CID from the log files
    - COD4 parser uses GUID in log files as PBID
    - Does not use the team from a kill event if it's empty, instead relies on team from previous events - TK plugin works again!
- Made !iamgod work automatically when there are no superadmins in the database, can be completely disabled by adding <set name="iamgod">none</set> to plugin_admin.xml
- Fixed: getWarning errors had the text "getSpam" instead of "getWarning"
- Added a replay log mode. Simply set the config to an old game log and server.replay to on in b3.xml. Only works for COD4 log files. Used to debug b3.
- Fixed clients.py to save the last used ip. Fixes empty ip fields in clientrecords and the countryfilter plugin to work properly.
- Added ioUrT41 parser (Urban Terror)
- Added WoP parser (World of Padman)
- Replaced xlrstats plugin with latest version 0.6.0
- Replaced status.py with latest version.
