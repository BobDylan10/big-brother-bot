-----
- Added COD4 parser
    - COD4 parser uses GUID instead of CID from the log files
    - COD4 parser uses GUID in log files as PBID
    - Does not use the team from a kill event if it's empty, instead relies on team from previous events - TK plugin works again!

- Fixed: getWarning errors had the text "getSpam" instead of "getWarning"
- Added a replay log mode. Simply set the config to an old game log and server.replay to on in b3.xml. Only works for COD4 log files. Used to debug b3.
